# Gatekeeper Operator

Supported through your
[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/5ec54aa3535cb70ab8c02996)
or
[OpenShift Platform Plus](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/platform-plus)
subscription, the Gatekeeper Operator installs
[Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/), which integrates
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) (OPA) with Kubernetes to provide a
comprehensive policy-based governance framework. Through
[admission controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/),
teams can define, manage, and enforce guardrails that ensure only policy-compliant resources can be
deployed. These guardrails help maintain security, compliance, and operational best practices.
