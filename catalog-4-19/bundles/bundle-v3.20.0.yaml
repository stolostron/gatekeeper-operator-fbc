              Gatekeeper is the schema for the gatekeepers API. Gatekeeper contains configurations for the Gatekeeper operator,
              which deploys Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper, a policy engine that enforces policies through admission controller
              webhooks.
              See https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper.

        Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper enforces CRD-based policies.

        Every organization has policies. Some are essential to meet governance and
        legal requirements. Others help ensure adherence to best practices and
        institutional conventions. Attempting to ensure compliance manually would be
        error-prone and frustrating. Automating policy enforcement ensures
        consistency, lowers development latency through immediate feedback, and
        helps with agility by allowing developers to operate independently without
        sacrificing compliance.

        Kubernetes allows decoupling policy decisions from the inner workings of the
        API Server by means of [admission controller webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/), which are executed
        whenever a resource is created, updated or deleted. Gatekeeper is a
        validating and mutating webhook that enforces CRD-based policies executed
        by [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa), a policy
        engine for Cloud Native environments hosted
        by CNCF as a [graduated project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/open-policy-agent-opa/).

        In addition to the admission scenario, Gatekeeper's audit functionality
        allows administrators to see what resources are currently violating any
        given policy.

        Finally, Gatekeeper's engine is designed to be portable, allowing
        administrators to detect and reject non-compliant commits to an
        infrastructure-as-code system's source-of-truth, further strengthening
        compliance efforts and preventing bad state from slowing down the
        organization.

        Gatekeeper has the following functionality:
        * An extensible, parameterized policy library
        * Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka "constraints")
        * Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka "constraint templates")
        * Audit functionality

        For more information, see the [Gatekeeper documentation](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/).
